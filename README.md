# Instasoup
Is a quick code excercise, where I wanted to do fast prototaping of the Instagram like home view screen in #SwiftUI

## Check the source code and:
- see whether you would do something similar of your view shaping approach would be way different than mine.
- play with the view model üé≤
- if you have any suggestions, please leave me an Issue ;) üçª
